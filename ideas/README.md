## Ideas

Problem

- preorder, inorder, postorder tree traversal
- fibonacci
- k-center => maybe just 1-center
- moving average stock market problem
- heapify a list (obfuscate the problem => maybe `sheep` pun)

----

We should try to incorporate each professor's research into one of the problems

- Dr. Galarus
