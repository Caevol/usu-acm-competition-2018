You are a solder in the Roman army manning a toll bridge.
A traveler pays with a bag of coins. Deceptively the traveler inserted a
single counterfit coin. The kings gold cannot be polluted and thus the
conterfit must be removed according to common law. Fortunately, you
know the conterfit coin weighs ever so slightly more than a `true` coin.

You possess a magical scale that given two piles of coins will indicate which pile of coins weighs more.
Unfortunately, you only have enough mana to use the scale `n` times.

What is the maximum number of coins that can be vetted in `n` weighings
or fewer?


10^9 + 7 !!!
